# Synchronator

From the official manual:

> The SYNCHRONATOR device adds video sync pulses and color coding signals to your audio input, thereby effectively disguising the audio as a composite video signal, compatible with all video equipment supporting composite video input.

The Synchronator was created by B Van Koolwijk and G J Prins in 2009.
